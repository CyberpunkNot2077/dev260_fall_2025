## 📋 Lab Structure - 6 Progressive TODO Methods

You'll implement **6 core methods** that build from basic BST operations to advanced tree analytics:

### TODO #1-2: Foundation Operations 🏗️

**Insert()** & **Search()**

- Master BST ordering property: left < root < right
- Learn recursive tree navigation and construction
- Understand O(log n) performance vs linear search

### TODO #3-4: Tree Traversal & Analysis 🔍

**InOrderTraversal()** & **FindMinimum()**

- Use in-order traversal for automatic sorting
- Navigate to leftmost node for minimum value
- Understand tree navigation patterns

### TODO #5-6: Advanced Operations 📊

**FindMaximum()** & **Count()**

- Navigate to rightmost node for maximum value
- Implement recursive counting for tree analytics
- Combine multiple BST concepts

Each method includes detailed comments explaining the BST concepts and real-world applications!

## 🛠️ Key Concepts You'll Master

### BST vs Linear Search

```csharp
// BST: O(log n) search through tree structure
var employee = employeeSystem.Search(12345);  // ~4 steps for 10,000 employees

// Linear: O(n) search through entire list
var employee = employeeList.FirstOrDefault(e => e.Id == 12345);  // Up to 10,000 steps
```

### BST Ordering Property

```csharp
// Left subtree < Root < Right subtree
//       50
//      /  \
//     30   70
//    / \   / \
//   20 40 60 80
```

### Automatic Sorting with Traversal

```csharp
// In-order traversal gives sorted sequence for free!
employeeSystem.InOrderTraversal();  // Output: 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80
```

## 💡 Real-World Connections

As you implement each TODO method, think about:

- **TODO #1 Insert()** - Like adding new employees to company database with instant organization
- **TODO #2 Search()** - Like HR system finding employee records in milliseconds
- **TODO #3 InOrderTraversal()** - Like generating alphabetically sorted employee reports
- **TODO #4 FindMinimum()** - Like finding the newest hire (lowest employee ID)
- **TODO #5 FindMaximum()** - Like finding the most senior employee (highest employee ID)
- **TODO #6 Count()** - Like generating headcount reports for management

Every method you implement mirrors real enterprise software patterns!

## 📖 Quick Reference

### Essential BST Operations

```csharp
// Tree construction
var employeeSystem = new EmployeeManagementSystem();
employeeSystem.Insert(employee);  // Build tree maintaining BST property

// Tree search - O(log n) performance
var found = employeeSystem.Search(12345);  // Navigate left/right based on comparisons

// Tree traversal - automatic sorting
employeeSystem.InOrderTraversal();  // Left -> Root -> Right = sorted output

// Tree analysis
var min = employeeSystem.FindMinimum();     // Leftmost node
var max = employeeSystem.FindMaximum();     // Rightmost node
int total = employeeSystem.Count();         // Recursive counting
```

### When to Choose BST

- ✅ **Need fast search** - O(log n) lookup performance
- ✅ **Dynamic data** - Frequent insertions with maintained order
- ✅ **Sorted output** - In-order traversal gives sorting for free
- ✅ **Range queries** - Finding min/max values efficiently
- ✅ **Hierarchical data** - Natural tree-like organization

### When to Choose Arrays Instead

- ✅ **Random access** - Need to access by index position
- ✅ **Small datasets** - Overhead not worth it for few items
- ✅ **Memory constraints** - Trees require additional pointer storage
- ✅ **Simple operations** - Just storing and iterating data
